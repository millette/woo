## Requirements

### Open Exchange Rates
You'll need to register for a free account at
<https://openexchangerates.org/signup/free>
to get 1000 queries per month. This script does a query
every hour (24 hours x 31 days) so a max of 744 queries a month.

### CouchDB
If you're CouchDB is not available on localhost:5984 per usual, or
you want to use another database name, you can edit ```.env```
and set DB_URL to another value, such as:

```
DB_URL=http://localhost:5993/markets
```
